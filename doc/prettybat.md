# bat-extras: prettybat

A script that uses [prettier](https://github.com/burntsushi/ripgrep) for reformatting and bat for syntax highlighting.



## Command Line

**Synopsis:**

- `prettybat [OPTIONS] [PATH...] `



**Options:**
Every option is passed through to `bat`.
See `man bat` for more information.



## Caveats

The header displayed by bat will show `STDIN` instead of the filename.
There's nothing that can be done about this with the current version of bat.
